#Dear reader,


The following document summarises the sales performance over 3 dimensions grouped by countries:


	- Unitary price
	- Revenue
	- Sold quantities

The critical countries where one should act upon are highlighted.

Kindly note that United Kingdom represents over 85% of the core business.
Therefore, one should focus its strategy in other countries, in other to minimise risk and diversity portfolio.


Best regards,

Francisco Freire
