**Pregunta:**
Can you asses the financial performance of Bank1 (Peruvian bank) during (2001-2017)?


**Intro:**
Analysis of the evolution of key performance indicators (NII and efficiency ratio). The selected indicators give an overall picture of the bank financial statements status, before deeping down into the analysis. When doing the analysis we have to take into account that during 2008 there was a severe financial crisis, which directly impacted banks.


**Nudo:**
Analysis of the ROA, ROE and NIM. After analysing the NII and the efficiency ratio; I have analysed the ROA, ROE and NIM to get a more detailed picture of which is the heatlh of the bank. Which seems to be healthy, again bearing in mind the financial sector environment of those years.


**Desenlace:**
Revenue breakdown and insights. After analysing all the key performance indicators, I have analysed the revenues breakdown of the bank and I have given my insights, firstly explaining I was analysing a retail bank, in Peru, a developing country, over the years 2001-2017, when a financial crisis took place (2008). Overall the bank has a healthy performance, however I can say it has room to improve its growth strategy and maybe target new market segments.
